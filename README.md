# Time-series-for-Mauna-Loa-CO2-concentration
This notebook presents the approach for a data science project utilizing time series. These tasks are part of the course titled "Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications." from MIT. The notebook includes an analysis performed on Mauna Loa C02 concentration dataset

# Dataset
In 1958, Charles David Keeling (1928-2005) from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography began recording carbon dioxide (CO) concentrations in the atmosphere at an observatory located at about 3,400 m altitude on the Mauna Loa Volcano on Hawaii Island. The location was chosen because it is not influenced by changing CO levels due to the local vegetation and because prevailing wind patterns on this tropical island tend to bring well-mixed air to the site. While the recordings are made near a volcano (which tends to produce CO), wind patterns tend to blow the volcanic CO2 away from the recording site. Air samples are taken several times a day, and concentrations have been observed using the same measuring method for over 60 years. In addition, samples are stored in flasks and periodically reanalyzed for calibration purposes. The dataset provides the concentration of CO2 recorded at Mauna Loa for each month starting March 1958.
